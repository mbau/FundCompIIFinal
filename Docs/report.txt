Fund Comp II Final Project -- Save the Fort! -- report.txt

The program is compiled from the source code by running make from the
directory containing the source code files. The program requires SDL and
SDL_gfxPrimitives to compile. The final program can then be run as "main". If
an argument is specified, the game loads lvlARG.txt as the level. By default,
it loads lvl0.txt.

When executed, the game starts up immediately. Endless waves of enemies appear
and follow a path to the base. If they reach the base, the player loses a
life. When the player runs out of lives, the game is over. The player's money,
lives, and score are all displayed at the top of the screen. To hold off the
enemies, the player must construct towers and upgrade their abilities. This
costs money, which is earned by defeating enemies.

To interact with the program, the player holds either left or right click to
open a pie menu on the current position. If a tower may be constructed, a list
of towers (currently Artillery and Slow) appears. While holding the mouse
button, the player highlights the desired option and releases the mouse
button. If the option is valid (i.e. can be afforded), the tower is built.
Likewise, if a tower is selcted, the menu presents a list of options relevant
to that tower type (i.e. freeze vs. damage). When selected, the corresponding
tower attribute is upgraded. Towers may also be destroyed to make room for
another tower. All build and upgrade options cost $500.

Required librarys: libSDL, libSDL_gfx
